# The Idea

We are building a website similar to StumbleUpon (a website for discovering new websites). Users can click to randomly show a website. Users can add in links to their favorite websites and have to display on the page for other users. Users can comment about the sites.

We will have a secret link that only us (admins) can access in order to update or delete things.
